# textbasedgame

I have been learning C for about ~1 1/2 months, this is my biggest project yet.
I didn't started this with the thought of it being a project or make it an incredible game, I just wanted to practice everything i learnt till now.
The game was created on Linux using libs like <stdio.h> , <unistd.h> , <string.h> , <stdlib.h>.
I didn't tested the game on Windows yet.
I accept every critique and feedback, I'm a big big noob and I barely consider that this is hard or anything but hey, embrace the journey.

Thankssss <3
